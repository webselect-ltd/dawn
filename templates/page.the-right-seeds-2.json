As a rule of thumb we would always recommend that you start by taking stock of what is there already, before making any changes. What is growing there? What kind of soil? Stony and dry, clay or loam?  Is it sunny or shady? If nothing thrives in a particular spot then that may be a clue that it's hostile environment plants, perhaps too dry and shaded and you may do better to choose a better spot. If there is a variety of species alreay then it could be tended and enhanced, rather than drastically changed.<\/p>",
