So much in our history and culture has taught us to conquer and dominate nature but I hope we are emerging from that way of thinking and returning to the memory that we are part of nature, sharing this earth with all the other living beings. In the face of ever encroaching concrete and tarmac, loss of wild spaces and social isolation, we can and must make a positive difference. By reclaiming patches of ground for wildlife in our gardens and in our neighbourhoods, we can transform monoculture into something more colourful and meaningful.<\/p>",
